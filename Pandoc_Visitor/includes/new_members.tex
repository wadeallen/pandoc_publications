\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{mugs/sarah_g} & Sarah Gough (pictured here with her husband, Mike) found First Baptist Church on the Internet, surfed our site, listened to sermons and then reached out to Wade about becoming involved.  Their meeting caused Sarah to want to learn more about the Lord and our church and, in January, she and Mike visited and, after one service, she came forward in a profession of faith to join the church and ask for baptism.  Their involvement was short-lived.  Shortly after that, Mike learned his job was transferring him to Detroit.  However, Sarah asked that she be baptized before they left.  In February, Sarah was baptized and the next morning the two pulled out for their new home, where they plan to be affiliated with a church.  We wish God's blessings on the Goughs and are grateful for the brief time they were part of our church.\\
