The summer mission trip to Camp Barnabas has been more than a get-a-way for our teens. It has inspired them to be involved in mission in their local high school. In October, Anna Allen and Kayla Cooper envisioned a school club that bridged the gap between mainstream students and special education students. They went to their principle at Yorktown High School with the idea. She enlisted them to present their idea to Special Education board; the club was approved. Last month, 81 students showed up for the first meeting. On Wednesday, December 18, they held their first event (a Christmas party). Students who attended Camp Barnabas with First Baptist were part of the event. Anna Allen, Kayla Cooper, Dawson Allen, Daniel Morency, Alex Childs and Anna Ratchford all have connections with First Baptist Church. It is exciting to see them involved in the club.   & \includegraphics[width=2in]{mugs/project_us} \\
