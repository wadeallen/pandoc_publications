% the way to pull in the birthdays is to download from database
% you then need to rename the file to month.csv i.e. June.csv
% and then run the command birthday month (i.e. June, i.e. birthday June) from the command line. This will make a file in the '/Users/wade/Dropbox/Pandoc/Pandoc_Visitor/Birthdays/' folder. This file can be edited if there are nicknames. vi
