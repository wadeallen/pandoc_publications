The Church Coordination Team (CCT) will be meeting in the church office on **Tuesday, July 16**, at **7:00 PM**.

## Children's Summer Schedule

ALL children’s classes, birth through 5th grade, will meet during the second service. Nothing changes for the babies and toddlers. Children pre-K through 5th grade will start in the sanctuary and will be dismissed by Wade as usual, and a helper will walk them downstairs. They will have a short worship time of their own, then break up into age-appropriate groups. The worship time they have together will take the place of the children’s choir time. They will work on a song in class to perform at the end of summer!

## Keeping Up

As we study the book of Revelation, it will be important to stay up to date with the study. If you miss a week or two, you might find it hard to make sense of how it all fits together. Let me encourage you to take the time to listen to the podcast or watch the sermon videos online. Summer is a season of travel and vacation. That makes this particular study a challenge. However, with the technology that we have available, you can keep up each week and get the most out of this study.

## Prairie Creek Reservoir Picnic

The FBC Children’s Team invites all children birth–5th grade to join us at Prairie Creek Reservoir (approximately five miles southeast of Muncie, south of the White River) at **11:30 AM** on **Saturday, July 20**. We will meet in the grassy area by the playground, closest to the beach. The children’s team will provide a picnic lunch, drinks, and dessert, as well as cover the cost for those who want to swim! (Bring a blanket, lawn chairs, etc. for the picnic; we won’t have a shelter house.) Let’s hope for a nice, sunny day. ;) **We do ask that you please accompany your children during this event**

## Digging Deeper

As we dig deeper in "Joining God in the Neighborhood" there will be many opportunities to go to places that provide services, to learn what their contributions are and, at a few, to volunteer briefly and get a feel for their work. On Wednesday evening, **July 24**, several of those organizations will come to us instead. The whole church is invited to come for supper at **5:30 PM**, and then there will be mini-presentations by a variety of organizations ranging from Alpha Center and Main Street Methodist Church to Children's Clothing Center. Childcare will be provided, and the event will end around 7:00. Sign up for any of the 12 opportunities on the bulletin board or by calling the church office. If each of us attends two events, we can promise our hosts very good interest in their work.

## Volunteers Needed

The children's team is in need of volunteers to help with Sunday School this summer.  We have teachers lined up, but still need "helpers" during first service during the month of July. Helpers will provide child care for ages pre-K through 2nd grade (there will be no lesson during this time!).  Please see Britney Sue at \texttt{765-215-6586} or Colleen Massoth at \texttt{765-744-1350} if  you're interested in helping out this summer! Thank you!
