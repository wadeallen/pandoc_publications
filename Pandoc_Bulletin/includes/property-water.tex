\subsection{Property Area Notes}
\label{propertynotes}


Please continue the good efforts already under way to report water leaks to the property team.  We have made great strides in the past few years to button up the church, but there are many areas that you visit during the week that the property team may not.  That team is building a list of capital repairs that will ensure our building stays structurally sound for decades to come.  We will take all of the input we can get.
