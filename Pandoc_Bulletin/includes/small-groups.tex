\subsection{Small Group Bible Study}
\label{smallgroups}

When was the last time you sat with a small group of people and discussed part of God's Word together? When did you last have a circle of trusted friends you could talk to about an issue in your life, knowing you could ask them to pray for you or to help you discover wisdom from Scripture for your situation? If it's been a while, we'd like to help you take the first step toward having this kind of support. First Baptist offers adults both Sunday school classes (during both Sunday AM services) and life groups (which meet in homes or restaurants) as a way to help you build friendships and learn from God's Word in an interactive, discussion-based setting. Nothing can take the place of meeting as a congregation on Sunday mornings to worship and learn together through pastoral teaching, but finding additional learning and support in a small-group environment might be the best decision you've made in a long time. If you'd like more information about either adult Sunday school classes or life groups, see Julie Davis.
