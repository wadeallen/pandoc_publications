\subsection{Time of Response}
\label{timeofresponse}

If you feel led by the Holy Spirit to respond publicly, you are invited to do so during the response song. The pastor will be down front to receive those wanting to publicly confess a new relationship with Jesus or to join the church family. If you would like to pray, the altar is open for private prayer or the pastor would be glad to pray with you. You are invited to respond as God would lead you.

\small\textit{    Now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation. 2 Cor. 6:2}
