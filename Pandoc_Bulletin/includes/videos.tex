\subsection{Sermons Online}
\label{timeofresponse}

If you missed last Sunday, you can always catch up on the sermons online. One way is to watch the videos on the church website at \texttt{fbcmuncie.org/videos}.

If you have a phone or tablet, you can also subscribe to the audio only version podcast at \texttt{https://fbcmuncie.org/podcast/fbcmuncie.xml}
