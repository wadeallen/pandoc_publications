\subsection{Church Cleaning}
\label{propertynotes}

As you are looking around your areas in the building and see large items that you no longer want in the space, bring that to the attention of Chris Wright, Property, and he will arrange to haul the items to the mission or the dump depending on the item.  Some things are just too large to put in the trash can, or too heavy to carry to the trash toters.  Several areas of the church have already had significant cleanup efforts and look much better these days.
