Blessed Be Your Name; In the land that is plentiful; Where Your streams of abundance flow; Blessed be Your name

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-2500}

Blessed Be Your name; When I'm found in the desert place; Though I walk through the wilderness; Blessed Be Your name

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-2000}

You give and take away; You give and take away; My heart will choose to say; Lord, blessed be Your name

# The Context {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=1000}

# Nathan {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=1200}

# {.step data-x=-1000 data-y=1200}

That night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: “Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in. 

*1 Chronicles 17:3–4 NIV*

# God's Plan {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=1400}

# Forever Promise {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=1600}

# David's Response {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=1800}

# {.step data-x=500 data-y=1200}

And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord GOD. You have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and this is instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD!

*2 Samuel 7:19 ESV*

# God's Plan {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=2000}

# {.step data-x=500 data-y=-3000}

So David gave orders to assemble the aliens living in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God. 

# {.step data-x=500 data-y=-2400}

He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed. 

# {.step data-x=500 data-y=-1900}

He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David. 


# {.step data-x=500 data-y=-1400}

David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame 

# {.step data-x=500 data-y=-800}

and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it.” So David made extensive preparations before his death. 

*1 Chronicles 22:2–5 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-2200 data-y=0}

“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”

*Luke 22:42 NIV*
