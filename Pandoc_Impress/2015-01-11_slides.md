# Incarnational {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=1400}

(Physical)

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=4000}

In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; 

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=4500}

rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.

*Philippians 2:5–7 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=4000}

The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

*John 1:14 NIV*

# Trinitarian {.step data-x=-3000 data-y=1400}

(Unified)

# {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=4000}

Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.

*John 14:10 NIV*

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=4000}

I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.

*1 Corinthians 1:10 NIV*

# Eschatological {.step data-x=-1000 data-y=1300}

(Future Oriented)

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=4000}

For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

*Jeremiah 29:11 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=4000}

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=-3000}

And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=-2540}

not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

*Hebrews 10:24–25 NIV*
