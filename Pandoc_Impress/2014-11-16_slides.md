As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; 

*1 Peter 1:14–15 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=-2000}

“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 

*Matthew 7:7 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=-1200}

You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.

*James 4:3 ESV*

# Which One? {.step .point data-x=-9500 data-y=-200 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=1500}

We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.

*1 John 5:19 NIV*

# Submitting {.step .point data-x=-9500 data-y=100 data-scale=2}

# Words {.step .point data-x=-9500 data-y=400 data-scale=2}

# Presumption {.step .point data-x=-9500 data-y=700 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=2200}

if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

*Romans 10:9 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=3000}

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, 

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=3450}

and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” 

*Matthew 11:28–30 NIV*
