Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.

Selfish Ambition = eritheia

I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=2400}

Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent or praiseworthy — think about such things.
