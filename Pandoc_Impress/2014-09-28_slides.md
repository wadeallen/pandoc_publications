# The Context {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=800 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=-2000}

Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.

*1 Chronicles 21:1 NIV*

# Counting {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=1100 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=-1500}

But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. 

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=-1100}

My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” 

*1 Chronicles 21:3 NIV*

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=-300}

“When you take a census of the Israelites to count them, each one must pay the LORD a ransom for his life at the time he is counted. Then no plague will come on them when you number them. 

*Exodus 30:12 NIV*

# Ignoring Advice {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=500 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=300}

the king’s command was repulsive to him

*1 Chronicles 21:6 NIV*

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=800}

This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel. 

*1 Chronicles 21:7 NIV*

# Realization {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=800 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=1500}

But David’s heart struck him after he had numbered the people.

*2 Samuel 24:10 ESV*

# Consequence {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=1100 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=2000}

God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood.

*Romans 3:25 NIV*

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=3000}

So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your choice: three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies, 

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=3540}

with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD — days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.’ 

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=3955}

Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.” 

*1 Chronicles 21:11–12 NIV*

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=4500}

That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp

*2 Kings 19:35 NIV*

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=5500}

David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. 

# {.step data-x=6000 data-y=5950}

Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. 

*1 Chronicles 21:16 NIV*

# Command {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=500 data-scale=2}

# Grace {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=800 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=-2000}

Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. 

*1 Chronicles 21:27 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=-1500}

That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” 

*James 4:6 NIV*

# {.step data-x=4000 data-y=-1000}

All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” 

*1 Peter 5:5 NIV*
