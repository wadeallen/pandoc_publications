Trials dark on ev'ry hand  
And we cannot understand  
All the ways  
  that God would lead us  
To that blessed promised land  

# {.step .song data-x=4000 data-y=8500}

And we'll follow till we die  
For we'll understand it  
better by and by

how we've overcome  
For we'll understand it

Disappointments have prevailed  
And we've wandered in the darkness  
Heavy-hearted and alone

But we're trusting in the Lord  
And according to His Word  
We will understand it  
better by and by

Temptations, hidden snares  
Often take us unawares  
And our hearts are made to bleed  
For some thoughtless word or deed  

# {.step .song data-x=4000 data-y=12500}  

And we wonder why the test  
When we try to do our best  
But we'll understand it  
better by and by  

# {.step .song data-x=4000 data-y=13000}

how we've overcome  
For we'll understand it

Not a blast of hurry  
touch the spirit there

Stayed upon Jehovah   
hearts are fully blest  
Finding, as He promised

perfect peace and rest
