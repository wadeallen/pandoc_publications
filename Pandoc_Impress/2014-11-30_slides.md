Lord of all

Jesus calls us o'er the tumult  
Of our life's wild, restless sea

His sweet voice soundeth  
Saying, "Christian, follow Me"  

# {.step .song data-x=-4000 data-y=8500}

Of the vain world's golden store  
From each idol   
that would keep us  
Saying, "Christian, love Me more"  

# {.step .song data-x=-4000 data-y=9000}  

In our joys and in our sorrows  
Days of toil and hours of ease  
Still He calls   
in cares and pleasures  
"Christian, love Me more than these" 

# {.step .song data-x=-4000 data-y=9500}  

Jesus calls us: by Thy mercies  
Saviour, may we hear Thy call  
Give our hearts   
to Thine obedience  
Serve and love Thee best of all
