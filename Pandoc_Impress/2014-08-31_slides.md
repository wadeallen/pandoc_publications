# Background Story {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-2800}

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=-2800}

In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. **But** David remained in Jerusalem. 

*2 Samuel 11:1 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=3000 data-scale=4}

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=-2000}

Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man!" . . .

*2 Samuel 12:7 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=3000 data-scale=4}

# Sin {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-2600}

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=-1000}

He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else

*Benjamin Franklin*

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=-500}

Excuses are the nails used to build a house of failure

*Don Wilder*

# The Tax Collector {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-2400}


# {.step data-x=0 data-y=200}

The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men --- robbers, evildoers, adulterers --- or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.' 

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=900}

"But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=1600}

"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." 

*Luke 18:11-14 NIV*


# {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-1000}

Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight

# {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-500}

Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place. 

*Psalms 51:4-6 NIV*

# Forgiveness {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-2200}

# Results {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=-2000}

# {#overview .step .first data-x=-4000 data-y=0 data-scale=10}

# {.step data-x=-7500 data-y=200}

That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

*Romans 10:9 NIV*
