Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 

*Hebrews 12:1 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-6500 data-y=2000}

Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.

*1 Peter 2:1 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=2000}

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.

For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. 

*Romans 2:13 NIV*

Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, 

# {.step data-x=-6500 data-y=3000}

and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 

*Genesis 1:26–27 NIV*

“Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan. 

*Exodus 22:22 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-3500 data-y=3000}

For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing.

*Deuteronomy 10:17–18 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=3000}

For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.

*Matthew 25:35–36 NIV*
