If anyone curses his father or mother, he must be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother, and his blood will be on his own head. 

*Leviticus 20:9 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=1500} 

If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders 

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=2300} 

at the gate of his town. They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.” Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death.

*Deuteronomy 21:18–21 NIV*

“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” 

*Luke 22:42 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-3500 data-y=3300} 

Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves. I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. 

# {.step data-x=-3500 data-y=4000} 

He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. 

# {.step data-x=-3500 data-y=4600} 

You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. “If you love me, you will obey what I command. 

*John 14:11–15 NIV*

Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 

# {.step data-x=-5000 data-y=4450} 

If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 

*Hebrews 12:7–8 NIV*
