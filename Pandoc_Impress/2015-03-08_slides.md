The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.

But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.

Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.”

*Isaiah 29:14 NIV*

# Logos vs. Sophia {.step data-x=-2300 data-y=300 data-rotate=90 data-scale=2}

Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom.

*Acts 6:3 NIV*

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=1500}

Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!

*Romans 11:33 NIV*

# {.step data-x=1500 data-y=1500}

For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.

*1 Corinthians 1:17 NIV*

 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, 
 
# {.step data-x=1200 data-y=-1400}
 
 being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross!

*Philippians 2:6–8 NIV*

# God's Way {.step data-x=-1500 data-y=-3500 data-rotate=-90 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=-400 data-y=-3000 data-scale=1.5}

God's way does *not*  
*always* make sense

# {.step data-x=300 data-y=-2500}

For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

*1 Corinthians 1:18 NIV*
