*1 Samuel 2:35 NIV*

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-2200}

When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel. The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, 

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-1600}

and they served at Beersheba. But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice. 

*1 Samuel 8:1–3 NIV*

*1 Samuel 13:1 NIV*

Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.

*1 Samuel 15:3 NIV*

# {.step data-x=3200 data-y=-1400}

But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs — everything that was good . . .

Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel: “I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.”

*1 Samuel 15:10–11 NIV*

# God's Choice {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=-1300 data-scale=2}

# {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=2000}

Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; 

# {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=2550}

not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 

# {.step data-x=-2000 data-y=3200}

He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things — and the things that are not — to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him. 

*1 Corinthians 1:26–29 NIV*

For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.

*2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV*

Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.

The thing I love about David is that no matter how many times he messed up, he ran to God instead of running from God
