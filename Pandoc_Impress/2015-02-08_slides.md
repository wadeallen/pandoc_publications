We are a Spirit-led people gathered to care for and empower each other by stewarding God's resources to impact our community for Christ

# Beginning with Jesus {.step data-x=-7000 data-y=3500 data-rotate=90}

# Salt {.step data-x=-6500 data-y=4000 data-rotate=90}

# {.step data-x=-5900 data-y=3300}

# {.step data-x=-5800 data-y=3450}

*Matthew 5:16 NIV11-GK*
