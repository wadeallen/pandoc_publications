When we walk with the Lord  
In the light of His Word  
What a glory He sheds on our way

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=8000}

While we do His good will  
He abides with us still  
And with all who will trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=8500}

Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=9000}

Not a shadow can rise  
Not a cloud in the skies  
But His smile quickly drives it away

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=9500}

Not a doubt nor a fear  
Not a sigh nor a tear  
Can abide while we trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=10000}

Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey

Not a burden we bear  
Not a sorrow we share  
But our toil He doth richly repay

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=11000}

Not a grief nor a loss  
Not a frown nor a cross  
But is blessed if we trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=11500}

Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=12000}

But we never can prove  
The delights of His love  
Until all on the altar we lay

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=12500}

For the favor He shows  
And the joy He bestows  
Are for those who will trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=13000}

Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=13500}

Then in fellowship sweet  
We will sit at His feet  
Or we'll walk by His side in the way

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=14000}

What He says we will do  
Where He sends we will go  
Never fear only trust and obey

# {.step .song data-x=0 data-y=14500}

Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah  
Pilgrim through this barren land  
I am weak, but Thou art mighty

Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand  
Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven  
Feed me till I want to more  
Feed me till I want to more

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=8000}  
Open now the crystal fountain  
Whence the healing stream doth flow  
Let the fire and cloudy pillar

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=8500}

Lead me all my journey through  
Strong Deliv'rer, strong Deliv'rer  
Be Thou still my strength and shield  
Be Thou still my strength and shield

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=9000}

When I tread the verge of Jordan  
Bid my anxious fears subside  
Bear me through the swelling current

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=9500}

Land me safe on Canaan's side  
Songs of praises, songs of praises  
I will ever give to Thee  
I will ever give to Thee
