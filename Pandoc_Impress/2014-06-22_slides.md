# 1 Samuel 19 {.step data-x=-2500 data-y=2800 data-scale=5}

The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. 

# {.step data-x=3000 data-y=-2400} 

Saul had a spear in his hand and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice. 

*1 Samuel 18:10–11 NIV*

In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him. When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.
