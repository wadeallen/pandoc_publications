For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

# Taming {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=400}

# Poison {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=600}

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=0}

Reckless words pierce like a sword

*Proverbs 12:18 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=1000}

a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit. 

*Proverbs 15:4 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-2000}

They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent’s; the poison of vipers is on their lips. Selah

*Psalms 140:3 NIV*

# Hypocrisy {.step data-x=-4000 data-y=800}

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-1000}

Listen and understand. What goes into a man’s mouth does not make him ‘unclean,’ but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him ‘unclean.

*Matthew 15:10–11 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=500}

Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=850}

But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man ‘unclean.’

*Matthew 15:17-18 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=2000}

The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. 

*Luke 6:45 NIV*
