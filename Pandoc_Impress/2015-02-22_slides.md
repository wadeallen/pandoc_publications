And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.

*Matthew 16:18 NIV*

But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened.”

# {.step data-x=-7550 data-y=1200 data-rotate=-90}

But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 

# {.step data-x=-7050 data-y=1200 data-rotate=-90}

keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.

# {.step data-x=-6650 data-y=1200 data-rotate=-90}

For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.

*Romans 6:10 NIV*

Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many

*Hebrews 9:28 NIV*

# {.step data-x=0 data-y=1200 data-rotate=-90}

 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.

*Isaiah 53:5 NIV*

“Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

*Matthew 26:41 NIV*

Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,

*Hebrews 9:27 NIV*

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-1000}

When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-500}

Then the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.”

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=50}

The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.

*Genesis 6:1–4 NIV*

# Noah {.step data-x=-1000 data-y=500}

# Persecution {.step data-x=0 data-y=500}

# Baptism {.step data-x=1000 data-y=500}

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=800}

For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.

*1 Corinthians 10:1–2 NIV*

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=1500}

So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,  
Till my trophies at last I lay down;  
I will cling to the old rugged cross,  
And exchange it someday for a crown.
