(James 2:1 TNIV) My brothers and sisters, do you with your acts of favoritism really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ?

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=1000}

For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.

*Malachi 3:5 NIV*

He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=2500}

One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=2980}

Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. 

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=3500}

And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

*Matthew 22:35–40 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=4100}
