for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

Amazing grace!  
how sweet the sound  
   That sav'd a wretch like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found,  
   Was blind, but now I see.

# {.step data-x=2500 data-y=-2000 data-rotate=-90}

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  
   And grace my fears reliev'd;  
How precious did that grace appear  
   The hour I first believ'd!

# {.step data-x=3050 data-y=-2000 data-rotate=-90}

Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,  
   I have already come;  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,  
   And grace will lead me home.

All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away. 

# {.step data-x=3050 data-y=-500 data-rotate=90}

No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.

# {.step data-x=2650 data-y=-500 data-rotate=90}

Yet, O LORD, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.

*Isaiah 64:6â€“8 NIV*

# {.step data-x=1000 data-y=-500}

As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead. 

*James 2:26 NIV*

# {.step data-x=1500 data-y=0}

Take me and mold me,  
use me, fill me  
I give my life to the Potter's hand  
Call me, You guide me,  
lead me, walk beside me  
I give my life to the Potter's hand
