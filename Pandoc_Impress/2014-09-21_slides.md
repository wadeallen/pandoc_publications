# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=8000}

Years I spent in vanity and pride  
Caring not my Lord was crucified  
Knowing not it was for me   
  He died on Calvary  

# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=8500}

Mercy there was great   
  and grace was free  
Pardon there was multiplied   
   to me  
There my burdened soul   
  found liberty at Calvary

# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=9000}

By God's Word at last 
  my sin I learned  
Then I trembled 
  at the law I'd spurned  
Till my guilty soul 
  imploring turned to Calvary

# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=9500}

Mercy there was great   
  and grace was free  
Pardon there was multiplied

# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=10000}

Now I've given 
  to Jesus everything  
Now I gladly own Him 
  as my King  
Now my raptured soul 
  can only sing of Calvary

# {.step .song data-x=6000 data-y=10500}

Oh the love 
  that drew salvation's plan  
Oh the grace 
  that brought it down to man  
Oh the mighty gulf 
  that God did span at Calvary
