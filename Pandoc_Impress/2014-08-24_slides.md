# Confessional Prayer {#song2 .step .song data-x=2000 data-y=6500}

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=7200} 

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father;
We have erred,
and strayed from Your ways like lost sheep.
We have followed too much the devices
and desires of our own hearts.

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=7900}  

We have offended against Your holy laws.
Too often, we have left undone
those things which we ought to have done;
And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done;

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=8600}  

But You, O Lord, have mercy upon us.
You spare those, O God,
who confess their faults.
You restore those who are penitent;
According to Your promises declared unto us
in Christ Jesus our Lord.

# {.step .song data-x=2000 data-y=9300}  

And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake;
That we may hereafter live
a godly, righteous, and sober life,
To the glory of Your holy Name. Amen.
