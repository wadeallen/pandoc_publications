So David assembled all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. 

*1 Chronicles 13:5 NIV*

# {.step data-x=2200 data-y=-1400}

Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the chest to carry it. The poles are to remain in the rings of this ark; they are not to be removed. 

*Exodus 25:14–15 NIV*

# Stepping Away {.step data-x=1000 data-y=2200}

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-2000}

I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid

*Genesis 3:10 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-1700}

Sarah was afraid, so she lied 

*Genesis 18:15 NIV*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-1200}

When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid 

*Genesis 26:7 NIV*

Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever.”

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=-0}

David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it. He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:

Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites. 

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=1150}

He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it. 

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=1900}

It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way.” 


*1 Chronicles 15*

# {.step data-x=-8000 data-y=2600}

When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. 

*2 Samuel 6:13 NIV*
