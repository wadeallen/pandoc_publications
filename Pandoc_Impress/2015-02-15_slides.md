# Moses Radiant {.step data-x=-3400 data-y=-2000 data-rotate=90}

# {.step data-x=-10000 data-y=-3000}

When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.

<!-- 2 Corinthians 4:3-6 -->

# Veiled Gospel {.step data-x=-5500 data-y=-2000 data-rotate=90}

# {.step data-x=-10000 data-y=-2000}

 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away.

*2 Corinthians 3:12–13 NIV11-GK*

# Unveiled Faces {.step data-x=-5900 data-y=-2000 data-rotate=90}

# The Image of Light {.step data-x=-6300 data-y=-1750}

# {.step data-x=-10000 data-y=-1000}

And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

*Genesis 1:3 NIV11-GK*

# {.step data-x=-10000 data-y=0}

 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

*John 1:4–5 NIV11-GK*

# {.step data-x=1000 data-y=-3000}

This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, 

# {.step data-x=1000 data-y=-2400}

and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.

*John 3:19–21 NIV11-GK*

# {.step data-x=1000 data-y=-1500}

so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky

*Philippians 2:15 NIV11-GK*

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=-500}

When you look at a star like Sirius, located about 8 light-years away, you’re seeing photons that left the surface of the star 8 years ago and traveled through space, without running into anything

# Veils {.step data-x=-6000 data-y=0 data-rotate=90}

# Light {.step data-x=-6400 data-y=-200 data-rotate=270}

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=500}

“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 

# {.step data-x=2000 data-y=1050}

In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

*Matthew 5:14–16 NIV11-GK*
